## Problem

### Water Consumption

Recently, Chef visited his doctor. The doctor advised Chef to drink  **at least**  $2000$ ml of water each day.

Chef drank $X$ ml of water today. Determine if Chef followed the doctor's advice or not.

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $T$ — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains one integer $X$ — the amount of water Chef drank today.
### Output Format

For each test case, output `YES` if Chef followed the doctor's advice of drinking at least $2000$ ml of water. Otherwise, output `NO`.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings `YES`, `yEs`, `yes`, and `yeS` will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 2000$
- $1 \le X \le 4000$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
2999
1450
2000

```

```
YES
NO
YES

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Chef followed the doctor's advice since he drank $2999$ ml of water which is $\ge 2000$ ml.

 **Test case $2$:**  Chef did not follow the doctor's advice since he drank $1450$ ml of water which is $\lt 2000$ ml.

 **Test case $3$:**  Chef followed the doctor's advice since he drank $2000$ ml of water which is $\ge 2000$ ml.

        int t = sc.nextInt();
        
        while (t-- > 0) {
            int x = sc.nextInt();
            
            if (x >= 2000) {
                System.out.println("YES");
            } else {
                System.out.println("NO");
            }
