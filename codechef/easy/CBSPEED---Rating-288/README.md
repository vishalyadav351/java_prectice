## Problem

### Chef and Brain Speed

In ChefLand, human brain speed is measured in bits per second (bps). Chef has a threshold limit of $X$ bits per second above which his calculations are prone to errors. If Chef is currently working at $Y$ bits per second, is he prone to errors?

If Chef is prone to errors print `YES`, otherwise print `NO`.

### Input Format

The only line of input contains two space separated integers $X$ and $Y$ — the threshold limit and the rate at which Chef is currently working at.

### Output Format

If Chef is prone to errors print `YES`, otherwise print `NO`.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings `yes`, `Yes`, `yEs`, and `YES` will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq X, Y \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
7 9

```

```
YES
```

### Explanation:

Chef's current brain speed of $9$ bps is greater than the threshold of $7$ bps, hence Chef is prone to errors.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
6 6

```

```
NO
```

### Explanation:

Chef's current brain speed of $6$ bps is not greater than the threshold of $6$ bps, hence Chef is not prone to errors.

### Sample 3:
Input
Output

```
31 53

```

```
YES

```

### Explanation:

Chef's current brain speed of $53$ bps is greater than the threshold of $31$ bps, hence Chef is prone to errors.

### Sample 4:
Input
Output

```
53 8

```

```
NO
```

### Explanation:

Chef's current brain speed of $8$ bps is not greater than the threshold of $53$ bps, hence Chef is not prone to errors.

class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args)
	{
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int x = sc.nextInt();
		int y = sc.nextInt();
		
		if (x<y)
		{
		    System.out.println("YES");
		}
		else
		 System.out.println("NO");
		
	}
}
