# Tower Of Hanoi

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given  **n**  disks placed on a starting rod (from), with the smallest disk on top and the largest at the bottom. There are three rods: the  **starting**  rod(from), the  **target**  rod (to), and an  **auxiliary** rod (aux).
You have to calculate the minimum number of **moves**  required to transfer all  **n**  disks from the starting rod to the target rod, following these rules:
      1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
      2. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or on an empty rod.
Return the  **minimum** number of moves needed to complete the task.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: For n = 2, total 3 steps will be taken. Steps are as follows -
move disk 1 from rod 1 to rod 2
move disk 2 from rod 1 to rod 3
move disk 1 from rod 2 to rod 3

```

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 7
Explanation: For n = 3, total 7 steps will be taken.Steps are as follows -
move disk 1 from rod 1 to rod 3
move disk 2 from rod 1 to rod 2
move disk 1 from rod 3 to rod 2
move disk 3 from rod 1 to rod 3
move disk 1 from rod 2 to rod 1
move disk 2 from rod 2 to rod 3
move disk 1 from rod 1 to rod 3

```

```
Input: n = 0
Output: 0
Explanation: Total 0 steps will be taken.
```

 **Constraints:** 
  0 ≤ n ≤ 20
