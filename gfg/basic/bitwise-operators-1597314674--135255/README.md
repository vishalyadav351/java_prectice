# Bitwise Operators

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given three positive integers  **a**,  **b**  and  **c**. Perform some bitwise operations on them as given below:
 **1.**  d = a ^ a
 **2.** e = c ^ b
 **3.**  f = a & b
 **4.**  g = ~ e
 **Note: ^** is for xor.
Then print d e f g space seperately. Move the cursor to the next line after printing.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
Output: 0 1 0 -2
Explanation: We print d e f g after performing the given operations.
```

```
Input: a = 4, b = 5, c = 6
Output: 0 3 4 -4
Explanation: We print d e f g after performing the given operations.
```

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class GFG {
    public static void bitWiseOp(int a, int b, int c) {
        int d = a ^ a;
        int e = c ^ b;
        int f = a & b;
        int g = ~e;

        System.out.println(d + " " + e + " " + f + " " + g);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        if (sc.hasNextInt()) {
            int a = sc.nextInt();
            int b = sc.nextInt();
            int c = sc.nextInt();
            bitWiseOp(a, b, c);
        }
        sc.close();
    }
}
```
